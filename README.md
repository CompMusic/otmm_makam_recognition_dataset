# OTMM Makam Recognition Dataset 

This dataset is presented in our publication:

    Karakurt, A., Şentürk S., & Serra X. (2016).  MORTY: A Toolbox for Mode Recognition and Tonic Identification. 3rd International Digital Libraries for Musicology Workshop. 

It is composed of 50 recording from each of the 20 most common Ottoman-Turkish makams (modes) in [CompMusic Project](http://compmusic.upf.edu/)'s [Dunya](http://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/) Ottoman-Turkish Makam Music collection. This 1000-recording dataset includes many different forms and instrumentations of varying lengths and there are historical, as well as, modern recordings.

This repository is composed of the pitch tracks of these recordings, these are generated by a [predominant melody extractor](https://github.com/sertansenturk/predominantmelodymakam/commit/f8b7302bc657f90e2b10a0ffd988902935adc3d6) optimized for OTMM culture. These pitch tracks are recorded as text files of single column that contains the frequency values. The timestamps are removed to reduce the filesizes. The timestamps are expected to be equally spaced. For this dataset, the time step size of the pitch track is 0.0029025 seconds, with which one can recompute the timestamps of samples.

The names of pitch tracks are their MBIDs (plus their pseudo-extension .pitch), which stands for MusicBrainz IDs. MusicBrainz is a music metadata hosting website. For information about a recording, use the following URL, by replacing MBID with the actual MBID.`http://musicbrainz.org/recording/MBID`

A complementary toolbox for this dataset is [MORTY](https://github.com/altugkarakurt/morty) which is a mode recogition and tonic identification toolbox. It can be used and optimized for any modal music culture. Further details are explained in the publication above.
