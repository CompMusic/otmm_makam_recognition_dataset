This dataset is composed of 50 recording from each of the 20 most common
Ottoman-Turkish makams (modes) in [CompMusic](http://compmusic.upf.edu/)'s [Dunya](http://dunya.compmusic.upf.edu/)
Ottoman-Turkish Makam Music collection.
This 1000-recording dataset includes many different forms and instrumentations
of varying lengths and there are historical, as well as, modern recordings.

This repository is composed of the pitch tracks of these recordings, these
are generated by the pitch.py script in [pycompmusic](https://github.com/mtg/pycompmusic)
project's *pycompmusic-master/compmusic/extractors/makam* directory. Any other
pitch track extraction method can be used, but the output should be of the
same format to be able to use with the [ModeTonicReocnition library](https://github.com/altugkarakurt/ModeTonicRecognition), which is
basically text files of single column that contains the frequency values.
The timestamps are removed to reduce the filesizes. The timestamps are expected
to be equally spaced. For this dataset, the time step size of the pitch track
is 0.0029025 seconds. This information must be fed into some of the functions
to generate time tracks internally, whenever they are required.

The names of pitch tracks are their MBIDs (plus their pseudo-extension .pitch),
which stands for MusicBrainz IDs. MusicBrainz is a music metadata hosting
website. For information about a recording, use the following URL, by replacing
MBID with the actual MBID.

More details to be added soon, when the related chapter of our technical
report is completed.
